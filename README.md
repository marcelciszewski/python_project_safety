**E-Safety Project (School Version):**
==================================

Please read the following. It will definitely help you.
Also, I put some time into this, so yeah. Please do.

Introduction:
=============

Welcome to the E-SAFETY PROJECT QUIZ by Marcel Ciszewski.
This project educates younger people into good decisions,
on the internet using an interactive interface, and quick
functions, and utilities to help you get e-safety smart.

Contents:
=========

demovideos - contains demostration videos on how to use
	     the utilties and installation utilites 
	     embedded in the files.

offline_files - contains offline files, in the case of 
		an unreliable internet connection, or 
		any other reason. Please note that the
		-se may not be up-to-date.

project - contains the powerhouse of the quiz. Easy to
	  run, via Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal 
	  (MacOS or Linux (UNIX)). IDLE can be used, but
	  is discouraged to due the lack of features 
	  present in the software (cannot be cleared
	  and made more user friendly.)

quickinstall.py - contains a reliable and robust script
		  in order to download the latest and
		  greatest E-SAFETY PROJECT QUIZ. 
		  Simple controls.
		  Quick flow. That's just right.

Brief Introduction:
===================

The E-SAFETY PROJECT QUIZ contains nine, unique and great
scenarios/sets of questions, all containing a range of at
least 5-8 questions each. Contains modules like:
- os
- datetime
- webbrowser
- wget
and much more...

Warning:
========

This project can take upwards of about 20-30 minutes to 
complete. Make sure you have time set aside.
This project also has a special module, called wget.
This module is not present in the baseline version of
python, meaning, if not installed, could throw an error.
Disabling wget is easy in the quiz. At the start of the quiz,
you will be asked whether wget is installed. If you do not have
it installed, answer "no" to the input. If you do, answer "yes"
to the prompt.

OPTIONAL: Installing wget:
==========================

**WINDOWS:** _Installing wget on Windows is moderately easy. 
	 Requires adminstrator permissions, and access to
	 Command Prompt (better known as CMD).
	 Simply go to Google, and search up a tutorial._

**MACOS:** _Installing wget on MacOS is difficult. It is annoying
       to get around in some areas. Installing PIP is the easiest
       and by far the best option. Manual Install is only 
       left for advanced users. Similarly with Windows, there
       are some tutorials online._

**LINUX:** _Installing wget on Linux is by far the easiest option.
       Only requires apt-get, and pip. Plain easy. Might be
       more complicated on other versions other than
       Ubuntu (The one I use and have tested.)_

Marcel Ciszewski -

I have written pretty much ninety-nine percent of the code.
Some code may be from StackOverflow (very useful.)
Nearly all text is completely written by me. Some explainations
are from www.childnet.com. The screen time video, is not mine,
and I don't own rights to it. It was a news broadcast.
The website text is not mine as well. Both the video and the 
website can be looked up with a quick google search.

Additional Info
================

I would like to thank you for using my code. This was 
based for a E-Safety project (Year 9). 

Marcel ;)
